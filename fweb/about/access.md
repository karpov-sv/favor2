Accessing the Mini-MegaTORTORA data
====

Most of MMT data are still not publicly available. If you are interested in it, or have a problem to be solved with it, please contact us! We are interested in collaborating on any possible topics.

### Meteors ###

We have opened the "live" [database of meteors](/meteors/) detected by MMT-9, which also includes historical events from FAVOR camera observations back in 2006-2009. The database is maintained by [Sergey Karpov](mailto:karpov.sv@gmail.com), please contact him if you have any questions.

If you use historical FAVOR data, please cite the following papers:

Zolotukhin, **"Optical camera with high temporal resolution to search for transients in the wide field"**, 2005, *Nuovo Cimento C*, 2005, vol. 28, issue 4, pp. 747-750 - [ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005NCimC..28..747K) - [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0507405)

In you wish to use MMT-9 (recent and actively maintained) data, please contact us directly for relevant terms. The paper describing the database is in preparation.

### Satellites ###
